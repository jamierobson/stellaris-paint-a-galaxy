# Guided Galaxy Generation

Proof-of-concept for a semi-random galaxy map, for potentially future use in StellarMaps:
- Paint where you want stars
- Generate stars
- (Optionally) clear canvas
- Generate connections

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev --open
```

## Building

To create a production version:

```bash
pnpm build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm preview`.
